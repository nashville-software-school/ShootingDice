# Shooting Dice

## A C# Exercise

### The Story

You are building a dice game. Like any good game, your game should have players. But you don't just want a single kind of player. No. You want your game to be interesting, so you want many types of players.

The goal of this exercise is to create classes to represent those various types of players and to write a `Program` class that will test them out.

### The Setup

1. Clone this repo.
1. Create a new repo under your github account.
1. Change the remote origin of the local repo to your new github repo.

### The Task

1. Read the existing code. Add or modify comments as needed to help you understand it.
1. Add code to each "Player" class to make it behave the way it should.
    * See the comment above each class for instructions. 
    * Complete the classes in the order specified below.
1. AFter completing each class, use it to create one ore more Player objects in the `Main()` method. Write code to test these new objects.
1. Add the new Player object(s) to the `players` list, so they will be passed to the `PlayMany()` method.

#### You should complete the classes in this order:

1. `SmackTalkingPlayer`
1. `OneHigherPlayer`
1. `HumanPlayer`
1. `CreativeSmackTalkingPlayer`
1. `SoreLoserPlayer`
1. `UpperHalfPlayer`
1. `SoreLoserUpperHalfPlayer`
